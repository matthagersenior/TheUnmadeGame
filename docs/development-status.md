# THE UNMADE — Engineering status

**Snapshot:** 2026-10-08. Source repository: `matthagersenior/TheUnmadeGame` (`main`).

## Repository source present
- Approved design v0.3 and eight-task first-playable implementation plan.
- Unreal C++ descriptor, game/editor targets, module, game mode, third-person camera, movement, temporary input mappings and temporary visible character mesh.
- Runtime-generated hub blockout with ground, buildings, anomalous marker and five placeholder NPCs (no authored `.umap` exists).
- Individual NPC memory component with witness vs attributed rumor, deduplication, reactions, bounded observations, and identity-bound snapshots.
- Line-of-sight/distance-limited witnessed actions (aid, anomaly test); proximity-gated aid cannot repeatedly reward the same NPC.
- Narrow `USaveGame` container persisting NPC snapshots to one prototype slot on actions; restoration when hub constructs.
- C++ automation source testing event provenance, rumor upgrade, snapshot idempotence and distinct fear/trust.
- Python static checks and source-contract tests under GitHub Actions.

## Still absent or unverified
- Unreal Engine compile, map spawn, player collision, actual NPC perception or snapshot save/load at runtime: **not tested without UE/GPU host**.
- Authored world visuals, character customization, realistic NPC routines, coherent combat abilities, actual Glimpse/Fold/Rewrite, dynamic rumor transmission, lexicon, full save semantics and quests.
- Windows packages, real device/controller acceptance testing, cloud server, secure Pixel Streaming Android session.

**Static CI can confirm repository/source contracts only; it cannot confirm Unreal C++ compiles or that gameplay works.**

## Next verification gate
Use a licensed Windows Unreal Engine 5.8 installation with enough GPU/VRAM. Open `TheUnmadeGame.uproject`, generate Visual Studio project files, compile Editor, launch standalone/PIE, and verify the runtime hub loads with a visible character and walkable floor. Run `Scripts/run_ue_tests.ps1 -UnrealRoot <root> -TestFilter Unmade`; investigate failures, record raw logs and tests. In PIE, verify E/H/F near NPC/marker, recall after quitting and restarting, distant NPC non-omniscience, and obstruction line-of-sight.

## Infrastructure
No paid hosting authorized or provisioned. The creator currently has Android but no PC. Interactive remote playtesting requires a separate GPU Windows host and explicit budget approval.
